# Ingredients

- Assorted veg: leek, onion, celery, red or green pepper, etc. — chopped fairly small or blitzed.
- 2–3 cloves garlic (or equivalent garlic paste)
- ~250g minced lamb per person
- Tomato purée
- 1 can chopped tomatoes or passata
- 250ml red wine
- Lasagne sheets
- Grated cheese

For the cheese sauce:

- 2oz / 55g butter
- 2oz / 55g flour
- Milk
- Grated cheese

# Method

1. Fry up the veg and garlic until soft.

2. Add the mincemeat and stir occasionally until the meat is cooked.

3. Add the tomato purée and tinned tomatoes.

4. Add the red wine and leave to simmer.

5. Make the cheese sauce (see [béchamel sauce](/bechamel-sauce.html)).

6. Layer the meat sauce, pasta sheets and cheese sauce in the lasagne dish, in that order (and finishing with the cheese sauce).

7. Sprinkle with grated cheese. If not cooking immediately it can be refrigerated at this stage.

8. Cook for about 40 mins in a moderate oven, until the cheese on top starts to brown.
