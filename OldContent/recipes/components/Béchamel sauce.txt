1. Combine roughly equal quantities of flour and butter over a low heat.

2. Add milk, a little at a time, stirring over a low heat until thickened.

3. This is one cheese away from being a cheese sauce ("Mornay sauce" if you’re feeling pretentious); add it when the sauce is a little less thick than you’d like it to end up. My preference is cheddar and some kind of Italian hard cheese to taste, and a bit of mozzarella for texture. English mustard, smoked paprika, and black pepper are also good additions.

The basic principle here is to combine a starch (generally flour) with any fat to gelatinise the starch, where it swells and absorbs water. The starch will do this on its own, but the fat prevents it from clumping. The starch molecules are fairly long and they become entangled with the fat and any subsequent liquid added, which further thickens the mixture.

This principle works with roux and milk to make béchamel sauce, but also animal fat, flour and water or wine in gravy.
