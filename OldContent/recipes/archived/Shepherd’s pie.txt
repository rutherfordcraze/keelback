# Ingredients

- Assorted veg: leek, onion, celery, red or green pepper, etc. — chopped fairly small or blitzed.
- 2–3 cloves garlic (or equivalent garlic paste)
- ~250g minced lamb per person
- Tomato purée
- Chopped tomatoes or passata (⅔ can, but I think more is fine)
- 250ml red wine
- Floury potatoes (e.g. King Edward’s or Maris Piper)
- Butter

# Method

Oven starts at 200°C.

1. Peel and boil the potatoes, then mash them with butter. Meanwhile:

2. Fry up the veg and garlic until soft.

3. Add the mincemeat and stir occasionally until the meat is cooked.

4. Add the tomato purée and tinned tomatoes.

5. Add the red wine and leave to simmer.

6. Once the mincemeat is done, add it to a baking dish and top with the mashed potato.

7. Dot with some more butter and bake for about 30 minutes, until the potato starts to brown.
