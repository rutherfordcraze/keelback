# Ingredients

- Chicken pieces
- Chicken stock
- 1 lemon
- Black peppercorns
- 1oz / 55g butter
- 1oz / 55g flour
- ¼ pint / 120ml double cream
- (Optional) Sprig of rosemary

# Method

Oven starts at 180°C.

1. Put the chicken pieces in a casserole and cover with chicken stock.

2. Peel the lemon with a potato peeler so there’s no pith, and add the peel to the stock.

3. Squeeze the rest of the lemon and add the juice to the stock.

4. Add pepercorns and rosemary.

5. Put the casserole in the oven for about 45 mins until the chicken is cooked through.

6. Set the chicken pieces aside. Strain the stock to remove the lemon peel, peppercorns and rosemary.

7. Make a roux with the butter and flour. Slowly add the strained stock until you have a thickened sauce.

8. Put the chicken pieces back in the (cleaned) casserole and pour the sauce over. If you’re cooking ahead, this is the point to put it in the fridge.

9. Reheat in the oven, stirring in the cream just before serving.
