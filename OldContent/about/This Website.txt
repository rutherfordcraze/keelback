title: About This Website
=====
This site is a place for me to write and share my thoughts in a longer and more personal format than would be possible on social media. There’s no guiding theme to the content, except that it’s what I want to write about.

The website itself is designed to be as simple and lightweight as possible. It uses a flat-file structure of text files in Markdown format, which are rendered according to HTML templates by a single ~250-line Python script. The exported site requires no JavaScript, and even the CSS is optional.

The site is also part of the [XXIIVV Webring](https://webring.xxiivv.com), a curated collection of personal websites.

## Analytics & Privacy

I collect basic, anonymous stats about site traffic using [Fathom](https://usefathom.com), a privacy-focused analytics service. It doesn’t use cookies or monetise your data (I pay monthly for the service).

If you’re interested in using Fathom for your own site, you can use my [referral link](https://usefathom.com/ref/MI6HFQ) for a $10 credit.
