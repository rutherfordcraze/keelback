title: Now
=====
I’m currently:

- Living in The Hague, Netherlands. My apartment is tiny, but it’s also right across the street from my favourite place to get coffee.

- Working on growing [this site](./keelback.html), and populating it with content from various other sources (old sites, notes, bookmarks, etc).

- Caring for a small but steadily-growing forest of [houseplants](./houseplants.html).

- Getting into [bicycles](./bike.html) — I picked up a 90s Campagnolo race bike which I’ve been using as a daily driver, and a 2011 Van Moof frame I’d like to rebuild (if I can get the bottom bracket off).

- Working on typefaces for [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com). I just released my latest (and biggest) project, [MD Nichrome](https://nichrome.mass-driver.com), a retro sci-fi-inspired design based on work I started in 2016–17.

- Reading _Dune_ (Frank Herbert)
