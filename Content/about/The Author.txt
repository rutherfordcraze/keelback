Hi, I’m Rutherford. I’m a designer and developer, and the founder of [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com/), a studio for typeface design and font production.

I was born in the UK, and I currently live in The Hague (NL), where I previously studied in 2018–19.

## Currently

- Working on typefaces.
- Gradually improving my coffee setup.
- Reading about spaceflight and rocketry.
- Writing (occasionally) for this site.
