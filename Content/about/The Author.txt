Hi, I’m Rutherford. I’m a designer and developer, and the founder of [Mass-Driver](https://mass-driver.com/), a studio for typeface design and font production.

I was born in the UK, and I currently live in The Hague (NL), where I studied for my MA in Type and Media in 2018–19. Prior to that, I studied graphic design at a university in the UK, and worked as a designer and developer for a web design agency.

## Currently

- Working on typefaces.
- Gradually improving my coffee setup.
- Reading about spaceflight and rocketry.
- Writing (occasionally) for this site.
