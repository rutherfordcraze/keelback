# Ingredients

- 4 fatty pork chops
- 3 sprigs rosemary, bruised
- 6 garlic cloves, flattened
- Grated zest of 1 lemon
- 2 tbsp maple syrup
- 2 tbsp olive oil
- 800g parsnips, peeled and cut into 2" batons
- 4 banana shallots, peeled and halved
- 3 medium conference pears, peeled, quartered and cored
- 250g black pudding, in 1–2cm chunks

# Method

Oven starts at 200°C

1. Trim fat & skin from chops. Cut into 3–4cm lengths and set aside.

2. Put rosemary, garlic, lemon zest, maple syrup, oil & black pepper in a freezer bag. Add pork chops and rub the marinade over them. Leave for as long as possible, ideally overnight.

3. Roast pork fat and skin in a large tin for 15 mins.

4. Add parsnips and shallots, shake, and roast for another 20 mins.

5. Take out the crackling and set aside. Add the pears, shake, and roast for another 20 mins.

6. Turn the oven up to 240°C. Shake, add the black pudding (on the surface of the tin), and put the chops on the top. Brush with marinade, and add the garlic, rosemary etc to the tin.

7. Return the crackling, but don’t sit it near any of the juices or it won’t crackle. Roast for another 15–20 mins.

8. Remove the chops, and give the veg and crackling a final 5 mins blast in the hot oven.
