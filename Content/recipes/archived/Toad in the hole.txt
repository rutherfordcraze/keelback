# Ingredients

- Sausages
- 4oz / 110g plain flour
- ½ pint / 240ml milk
- 2 eggs

# Method

1. Put sausages in a roasting pan with 1–2 tbsp oil, and place in a fairly hot oven while you make the batter.

2. Put the flour in a bowl, with a pinch of salt, and make a well in the centre. Beat the milk and egg together with a fork, and pour slowly into the flour, mixing it to a batter as you go.

3. Once the oil around the sausages is sizzling hot, pour the batter around (but not over) them.

4. Bake in a hot oven for about 45–50 mins, until done.
