# Ingredients

- 2 leeks, slit down the middle then thinly sliced
- 1–2 cloves garlic, sliced or chopped
- Bacon lardons or streaky bacon cut into strips
- Risotto rice (check the packet for quantities, I usually eyeball it)
- 250ml stock (a stock cube dissolved in water is fine)
- ~250ml white wine

# Method

1. Heat some oil in a heavy pan. Add the leeks, garlic, and bacon. Cook gently until the leeks and garlic are soft.

2. Add the rice and cook for 3–5 minutes.

3. Splash with wine and add some of the stock. Continue to add the rest of the stock and wine, a little at a time, until the rice has absorbed all of the liquid. Serve once the liquid is gone and the rice is cooked.

## Other risotto flavours

- Mushroom and mozzarella: stir in grated mozzarella at the end.

- Leek and tomato: use passata in place of some of the liquid.

- Lemon: add lemon juice to the liquid.
