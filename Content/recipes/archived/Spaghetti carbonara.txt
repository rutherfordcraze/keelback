# Ingredients

- Spaghetti (tagliatelle also works)
- 3oz / 85g butter
- 8 slices bacon, cut into thin strips
- 2 eggs
- 2 egg yolks
- Grated parmesan (or grana padano, etc.)
- ½ cup / 120ml double cream
- Salt & pepper to season

# Method

1. Cream the butter until soft.

2. Beat eggs, yolks, and half the cheese in another bowl.

3. Fry bacon until crisp and pour off any fat. Stir in the cream. Keep warm until the pasta is cooked.

4. When the pasta is cooked and drained, stir in the soft butter, then add the hot bacon and cream.

5. Add the eggs/cheese mixture, stirring to allow the heat of the pasta to cook the eggs.

6. Season liberally with pepper (easy on the salt since there’s probably enough in the cheese and bacon). Serve with more cheese on top.
