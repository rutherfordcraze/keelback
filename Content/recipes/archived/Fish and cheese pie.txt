# Ingredients

2. Make the cheese sauce (see [béchamel](/bechamel-sauce.html)).

3. Add the fish pieces to the sauce and heat through gently until they’re cooked. Don’t stir more than necessary to avoid breaking up the fish.

5. Spread the mashed potato on top of the fish & cheese mixture.

6. Slice the tomatoes and lay them over the top.

7. Sprinkle with grated cheese. Leave to cool if cooking ahead of time, otherwise:
