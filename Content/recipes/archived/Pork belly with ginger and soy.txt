# Ingredients

- 2 tbsp sunflower oil or beef fat
- About 1.5kg pork belly, cut into chunks
- 6 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
- 2 thumb-sized pieces fresh ginger, thinly sliced
- 3 tbsp tart fruit jam or jelly (e.g. redcurrant/plum/crab apple)
- 150ml soy sauce
- 350–500ml apple juice
- 2 tbsp cider vinegar
- 2 medium-hot chillies

# Method

Oven starts at 120°C.

1. Heat the oil in a heavy-based casserole.

2. Season the meat and brown in batches, setting them aside when well-browned.

3. Turn down the heat and cook the garlic and ginger gently until soft but not coloured.

4. Add the jam/jelly and soy sauce. Mix well, then return the meat to the pan (in a single layer if possible).

5. Pour in enough apple juice to barely cover the meat. Add the vinegar, chillies, and a few grinds of black pepper.

6. Cover andd out in a very low oven for 2½–3 hours, until the meat is completely tender.

7. Discard the chillies and serve with noodles and greens.
