# Ingredients

- 1 white onion, chopped
- Various mushrooms (I normally use 500–1kg of white, chestnut, or portobello mushrooms)
- Vegetable stock (liquid, but made from a cube is fine)
- Butter (probably slightly more than you think)
- ~2 tbsp white wine
- ~2 tbsp sour cream
- 2 tbsp plain flour
- Thyme
- Worcestershire sauce
- Tomato purée

# Method

1. Rougly chop the mushrooms. You could spend half an hour slicing them evenly, but haphazardly knifing them into randomly-sized chunks is every bit as effective.

2. Melt a reasonably large knob of butter in a sauté or frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion and stir to soften.

3. Add a pinch of tomato purée (a bit less than a tablespoon, maybe). Once it’s incorporated, add the flour and continue stirring for 30 seconds or so.

4. Before the flour and purée burns, deglaze with some stock. Keep adding the stock slowly to prevent the flour clumping.

5. Add the mushrooms, wine, thyme and a few dashes of Worcestershire sauce. Keep stirring for another 4–5 minutes.

6. Reduce the heat and let simmer for another few minutes. Once it’s thickened, remove from the heat and leave to stand for 30 seconds.

7. Before serving, add the sour cream and mix well.

Best combined with something, or as a side dish I think. I’m partial to serving it with mashed potato, but it’ll also work as something like a pasta sauce.
