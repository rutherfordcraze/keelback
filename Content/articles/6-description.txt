Greymarch is a text typeface which combines the historical flavour of Humanist calligraphy with more contemporary proportions and details. Intended for the more esoteric regions of editorial design, its shapes aim to be robust without becoming mechanical.

The typeface has a distinct personality, though it does not limit itself to being entirely serious or entirely playful: instead, its rationalised take on the calligraphic model places Greymarch in a pragmatic middle ground between liveliness and neutrality. This makes it a versatile choice for a wide range of editorial contexts and applications.

Greymarch is a text typeface which combines the historical flavour of humanist calligraphy with contemporary proportions and details. I intended the typeface to be used for editorial design, particularly independent magazines and smaller print publications.

The initial goal of the project was to create a typeface based on the calligraphic model, but over time I moved towards a more rationalised, modern design. The resulting typeface has a distinct personality which does not limit itself to being either entirely serious or entirely playful. Its shapes are robust and modern, but not rigidly mechanical; they show their calligraphic origins without becoming an imitation of handwriting.
