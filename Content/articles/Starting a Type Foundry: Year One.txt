I launched Mass-Driver on 20/02/20, at 2:02pm local time, while sitting in a café in The Hague where I often worked. Technically, the website was already live, and the company had been registered a month earlier, but February 20th is the date I consider to be the official anniversary. A year on, I wanted to share a few thoughts about what the first 12 months have been like.

To start with: I run MD on a budget of as close to zero as I can get. The website is almost entirely in-house, with the [back end](https://www.fontdue.com) and [analytics](https://usefathom.com) being the only costs, at under $50/mo between them. Although I mostly avoid them for design work, I test my fonts in the Adobe CC suite, which is another $50 per month.

To begin at the end: this has been intense, and while it’s been an ultimately positive experience, that’s mostly because I’m weird.

# Summary

I should probably begin with a little background, because Mass-Driver did not appear from nothing. I don’t remember a point when my eventual goal wasn’t to eventually run my own foundry, though I do remember it was somewhere in the first semester of TypeMedia that I began considering doing that from the start.
