# Daily Driver
My current daily driver is a 90s Campagnolo road bike, purchased mid-2021.

The frame is Reynolds 531c steel, 2x7 gears, and some nicely mismatched tyres (Continental Grand Prix 24mm on the back, no-name 26mm on the front) which I should replace soon.

It says ‘SNEL’ on the side (which means ‘fast’).

# Project Frame

Also mid-2021, I picked up a 2010 Van Moof No. 5 frame, which has been one of my favourite designs for some time.

The bottom bracket is seized, but if I can get it out, I’d like to rebuild the frame as a cargo/commuter bike.
